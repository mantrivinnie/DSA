# Bubble Sort

## Introduction

Bubble Sort is a **simple comparison-based sorting algorithm** that repeatedly **swaps adjacent elements** if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the entire array is sorted.

## Time Complexity

- **Worst-case time complexity**: **O(n²)** (When the array is reverse sorted)
- **Best-case time complexity**: **O(n)** (When the array is already sorted)
- **Average-case time complexity**: **O(n²)**

## Characteristics

- **Stable Sorting Algorithm**: Bubble Sort maintains the relative order of equal elements.
- **In-Place Algorithm**: Requires **no extra space**.
- **Multiple Passes**: Elements are gradually moved to their correct positions.

## Algorithm Idea

1. The **largest element** is placed at the end in the **first pass**.
2. The **second-largest element** is placed at the second-last position in the **second pass**.
3. This process continues until the **array is sorted**.
