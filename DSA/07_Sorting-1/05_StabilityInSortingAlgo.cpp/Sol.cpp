// Sort students by their marks
// If two students have same marks, then original order is preserved
// Stable sorting cares about the original order of elements

// Example of stable sorting
// Bubble sort,Insertion sort,Merge sort
// Example of unstable sorting
// Quick sort,Heap sort,Selection sort

// Bubble sort is stable because it compares adjacent elements and swaps them only if they are in wrong order
// So if two elements are equal, they will not be swapped and their order will be preserved

// Selection sort is unstable because it selects the maximum element and swaps it with the last element
