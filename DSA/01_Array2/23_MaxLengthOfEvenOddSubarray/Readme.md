# Alternating Subarray Length (Based on Kadane's Algorithm)

We calculate the maximum length of an alternating even-odd subarray using a concept similar to **Kadane's Algorithm**.

## Explanation:

- Begin traversing the array from the second element (`i = 1`).
- For every element, there are two possible cases:
  1. **Start a new subarray:**  
     Begin a new subarray if the current element is not alternating with the previous one.
  2. **Extend the previous subarray:**  
     Extend the length of the subarray if the current element alternates with the previous one (i.e., even followed by odd or odd followed by even).

This ensures an efficient computation of the maximum alternating subarray length.
